Welcome to the GitHub repository for our Abstractive Question Answering (AQA) model! In this project, we are excited to explore the world of Abstractive Question Answering by leveraging various components to build a robust and powerful system.

## Components

### 1. Retriever

The Retriever component plays a crucial role in our AQA model. It is responsible for efficiently retrieving relevant documents or passages from a corpus based on the input question. We'll be exploring different retrieval strategies to enhance the accuracy and speed of information retrieval.

### 2. Generator

The Generator component is the heart of our Abstractive Question Answering model. It focuses on generating concise and meaningful answers to questions by understanding the context and semantics of the retrieved information. We'll be experimenting with state-of-the-art natural language generation techniques to achieve high-quality responses.

### 3. Vector Database (Pinecone)

To facilitate efficient indexing and retrieval of vectors generated by our model, we'll be incorporating Pinecone, a powerful vector database. Pinecone allows us to store and query vectors effectively, contributing to the overall speed and scalability of our Abstractive Question Answering system.

## Data and Models

- **Dataset:** We will be using the *'vblagoje/wikipedia_snippets_streamed'* dataset to train and evaluate our Abstractive Question Answering model.

- **Retriever Model:** For efficient document retrieval, we will employ the *flax-sentence-embeddings/all_datasets_v3_mpnet-base* retriever model.

- **Tokenizer:** The tokenizer for our model will be *vblagoje/bart_lfqa*, which plays a crucial role in processing input data for both the retriever and generator components.

## Getting Started

You can directly aceess and run the Model by simply plugging your API's in the Colab I provided.

3. Explore the components:
   - Dive into the `Retriever` directory for retrieval strategies.
   - Check out the `Generator` directory for abstractive answer generation.
   - Integrate Pinecone into your workflow by exploring the `Vector-Database` directory.

Feel free to experiment, contribute, and collaborate to enhance our Abstractive Question Answering model. We look forward to building an innovative and effective solution together!
